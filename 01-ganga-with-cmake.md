Before starting, you should read the [first Ganga lesson][first-ganga], which
gives some advice about choosing a Ganga version, making a clean environment
for running Ganga in, and where to go to get help when things in Ganga go
wrong.

We will create a local version of DaVinci with some modified algorithm, so that
we can check that Ganga is using the local version when we submit a job.
First, we'll create a local DaVinci with `lb-dev`, and will then fetch the
[`DecayTreeTuple`][dtt-package], which lives under the `Phys` hat.

```shell
$ lb-dev DaVinci v41r2p1
$ cd DaVinciDev_v41r2p1
$ git lb-use Analysis
$ git lb-checkout Analysis/v17r3 Phys/DecayTreeTuple
```

We will do something silly as a test: add a `_2M` branch to
`TupleToolKinematic` that fills twice the invariant mass of the particle. To do
this, we just need to edit the implementation file at
`src/TupleToolKinematic.cpp`.
Line 76 of that file reads like this:

```cpp
test &= tuple->column( prefix+"_M", P->momentum().M() );
```

Here, `tuple` is a object representing the ntuple to be filled, and the
`column` method tells the ntuple to fill the branch named by the first argument
(a `string`) with the value of the second argument.
Create a line just below this one, using `_2M` as the branch name suffix as
twice the particle mass as the value.

```cpp
test &= tuple->column( prefix+"_2M", 2*P->momentum().M() );
```

Then we just need to compile our local DaVinci package. You must be in the
`DaVinci_v40r1p3` when executing the following commands:

```shell
# Using -j8 runs up to 8 tasks in parallel, speeding up the build
$ make -j8
$ make install
```

This will create a folder called `InstallArea`. This is the folder that Ganga will provide on the Grid.

Now we can proceed as usual, defining a job running DaVinci in Ganga. But instead of
using the built in version of our app (`DaVinci()`), we will use `GaudiExec()` to make a
custom application:

```shell
$ lb-run Ganga/v602r2 ganga
```

```
j = Job(name='Local_DaVinci_Test')
myApp = GaudiExec()
myApp.directory = "/path/to/DaVinciDev_v41r2p1"
myApp.options = ["/path/to/DaVinciDev_v41r2p1/myOptions.py"]
j.application = myApp
j.inputdata = [...]
j.outputfiles = [LocalFile('*.root')]
j.submit()
```

> ## Details of GaudiExec {.callout}

> Here, `.options` is a list of arguments that are passed to `gaudirun.py`. The actual command
> looks like:

> ```bash
$ ./run gaudirun.py [options contents] [inputdata contents]
```
>
> If you want to run a program directly without the `gaudirun.py` script, you can add `j.application.useGaudiRun = False`.
>
> For more info, do `help(GaudiExec)` in Ganga.

After running this job, confirm that you have a `_2M` branch in your output ROOT file.



> ## You know what to do {.challenge}

> To test this, we need an options file that defines a `DecayTreeTuple`, and
